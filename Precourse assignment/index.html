        <h2>A little geography</h2>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Nang">Da Nang</a> is one of the 
            largest cities in Vietnam, along with Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. 
            It lies on the coast of the South China Sea at the mouth of the Han River, 
            and is one of Vietnam's most important port cities. As one of the country's five 
            direct-controlled municipalities, it falls under the administration of the central 
            government.</p>

        <h2>Attractions</h2>
        <p>Da Nang attractions comprises manmade structures and natural beauty, 
            ranging from centuries-old pagodas, French colonial buildings and gothic-style 
            cathedrals to tranquil beaches, breath-taking mountains, and verdant national parks. 
            If you’re looking to soak up the sun while on vacation, visit Da Nang’s My Khe Beach 
            and Nun Noc Beach for fun-filled activities such as swimming and surfing.</p>

        <p>Set within the city centre, Cao Dai Temple and Da Nang Cathedral are religious-themed 
            attractions worthy of a visit while the nearby Marble Mountains fascinates visitors 
            with their many limestone caves used as both hideouts and places of worship. 
            History buffs also have plenty to see as the city is home to several unique museums, 
            which are dedicated to last century’s military conflicts, Vietnam’s beloved leaders, 
            and remnants of the ancient Cham civilisation. For your convenience, we’ve compiled a 
            comprehensive list of what to see in Nha Trang.</p>
